Our Story
</h1>
<p class="story">
Today, many of the largest school districts in the country serve  100% fruit and vegetable juices as a meal component for in-class breakfast, lunch, and supper feeding programs.

Through continued innovation and striving to meet the growing need in schools for natural ‚Äúclean label‚Äù beverages, JB‚Äôs Iced Tea was born. School nutritionists, students, and parents welcome the addition of a healthy, delicious option to their a-la-carte meal programs!

Juice Bowl‚Äôs future looks bright with new, innovative products in development to fill the growing need for healthier, natural beverages.

The Purity Cleanse contains the most fruits. Although there are some green juices and smoothies, the beginner-level cleanse eases you in with the delicious Taxi (pineapple), the sweet Tango (carrot) and the refreshing Basil (lemonade). The Purity Cleanse might be easier on your taste buds, but it‚Äôs still a challenge that will provide you a lot of nutrients coming from fresh organic fruits and veggies.

The purity cleanse is a perfect first-time cleanse üòâ

Each cleanse day contains 10 juices and smoothies that will replace your meals and snacks.

Delivery available in Quebec and Ontario Tuesday to Thursday.

    founded in 2013 by Doug Evans, who served as CEO until October 2016, when former 
    president of Coca-Cola North America Jeff Dunn took over the position. The company's
     juicing press was originally priced at $699 when launched in March 2016, but was 
     reduced to $399 in January 2017, 12 to 18 months ahead of schedule, in response to slow sales of the device.
</p >
<p class="ceo">Produce packs for the press, containing blends of pulped fruits and vegetables, cost 
between $5 and $7 and had a limited lifespan of about 8 days. Each pack had a QR 
code which was scanned and verified by the Internet-connected machine before it could be
 used. CEO Jeff Dunn claimed this was to prevent packs from being used past their expiration 
 date, and to facilitate food safety recalls, though critics felt that the feature was a form 
 of digital rights management as it would prevent operation of the press with any produce pack
  not made by the company.Industrial design for 
the press was completed by Yves Behar's studio Fuseproject, based in San Francisco.
